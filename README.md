This package historically provided TypeScript-aware blueprints for `ember generate`-ing standard entities, covering the blueprints normally provided by `ember-source` and `ember-data`. It is no longer maintained and Ember can support native TS blueprints itself now. See the [ember-cli-typescript](https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript) repository for more details on working with TypeScript in Ember!
